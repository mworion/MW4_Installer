Install MountWizzard4
=====================

When starting with the installation of MountWizzard4, python 3.8-3.10 for
versions 3.x and python 3.9-3.12 for versions 4.x should be successful installed.
To check, open a terminal (available on all platforms) and run the command

.. code-block:: python

    python3 --version
    virtualenv --version

On windows you can't call python3, but you have to run the command

.. code-block:: python

    python --version

In one of the choices you should see the version number of the installed and
available packages. For python it should say 3.8.x ... 3.12.x (depending on the
version of MountWizzard4).

.. hint::
    MountWizzard4 does not need admin rights to install or run. To avoid
    problems with accessing directories or file please ensure, that you run
    install and MountWizzard4 itself as normal user!

To install MountWizzard4 on your computer, there are some support available for
Windows, MacOSx and Ubuntu to make it a little bit easier to install and run
MountWizzard4. The scripts are online, and available from Github.

Installing with installer version 4.x:
--------------------------------------
The install procedure also got improved: You will have only a single compressed
python script (startup.pyz) which is valid for all platforms and does all things
the different existing scripts stand for. Additionally some support files are
present to make for Linux a good starter Please download the package and unzip
it to get the content. You will find four files:

- startup.pyz -> the script for doing all the work
- mountwizzard4.desktop -> support for ubuntu / linux running the script
- mw4.png -> icon for mountwizzard4.desktop
- mw4.ico -> icon to customize the link in windows for running the script

Process for installation
------------------------

Step 1
------
Please create a working directory of your choice and location. For MacOSx I
would recommend not using a location on the desktop as it might cause troubles
with execution right in newer OSx installations. The directory can be renamed
later on, it also can also be moved to any other location. Copy the scripts for
your platform into this directory.

Step 2
------
Download the **lastest** release of the installer script and unzip it's content
to your work dir. You will find it here:
https://github.com/mworion/InstallerMW4/releases

In Windows10 for the first time you might be asked again for permission.

.. image:: image/win_a.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Please accept this and follow the step the install marked in red.

.. image:: image/win_b.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 71%

Step 3
------
Run the installer script, on windows you should be able to start the script just
be double click on it, in all other platforms you start it with:

.. code-block:: python

    python startup.pyz  # Windows
    python3 startup.pyz # Ubuntu and OSx

This script will prepare an virtual environment, install all necessary libraries
- if applicable for arm plattforms (RPi's) also precompiled wheels and
MountWizzard4 itself. After a successful installation, the script will start
MountWizzard4 the first time. During this first run MountWizzard4 will create
some subdirectories in your working folder. When starting, a splash screen shows
the progress of it's initialization. After first start the directory should
look like (example Windows)


Remarks for installation
------------------------
MountWizzard4 is installed inside the virtual environment venv in your work dir.
Once installed, the startup.pyz script is also used for starting MountWizzard4
at any time.

.. hint::
    Please check if an online connection is available on your computer during
    installation as the libraries and MountWizzard4 is installed from online
    sources.

.. hint::
    Over time, there might be some improvements also made for these scripts.
    So if you had installed MountWizzard4 some time ago and will install new
    setups, it might be helpful to check if some new scripts are available for
    better handling. When running the script, it will check for updates and
    gives you some hints.

.. hint::
    The new script 4.x supports multiple platforms (Windows, MacOSx, ARM and x86
    Linux distributions! Still for some you need to do some preparations.


Short videos for installation
-----------------------------
For a better impression of how MountWizzard4 could be installed, there are some
special videos showing a installation on different platforms.

    * Mac OS Catalina: https://youtu.be/bbZ9_yLm1TU

If you see the upper window, you succeed and from now on you are able to
customize your setup of MountWizzard4 and it's features. Please refer to the
MountWizzard4 documentation for further information.

Setting up Ubuntu
-----------------
For Ubuntu the scripts also include an icon file (mw4.png) as well as a desktop
description file (MountWizzard4.desktop). In order to use this add-on, please
adjust the directories used in this file:

.. image:: image/ubuntu_setup.png

Unfortunately this is broken un Ubuntu 20.04LTS, see (including the workaround):

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1231413/basic-desktop-actions-are-not-available-on-ubuntu-20-04

If you install nemo (hint as workaround) as file manager, the desktop icons will
work.
